      What is animal abuse?<br /><br />
Animal abuse falls under a lot of different umbrellas. But in general, it is when a human being knowingly commits physical, mental, or emotional harm to an animal. This can be in many forms like torture, neglect, and even malnutrition. 
<br /><br />
How many animals are abused each year?<br /><br />
We will never have a true number. A lot of industry deaths aren’t recorded but the ones we know about are in the hundreds of millions. That isn’t counting the countless animals killed on the black market or by shelters each year. 
<br />
What are the effects of animal cruelty? <br /><br />
Unfortunately, like with all forms of abuse, it creates an ongoing cycle of destruction. A human abuses an animal, the animal becomes aggressive, it can’t find a home, it doesn’t get fixed leading to puppies, and those same puppies go through the cycle all over again.
