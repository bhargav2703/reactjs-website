Many NGOs, despite their noble work and excellent execution, have lacked the recognition, especially recognition from individuals who are passionate about the areas these NGOs work on and want to contribute in any capacity.This has prevented NGOs from scaling and becoming essential pillars for social and ecological growth in our society. <br /><br />

Fundraising is one of the most important pieces of the organizational jigsaw. Quite clearly, without funds, an NGO will cease to exist or at least not be able to effectively serve the communities that it has been set up to serve. In what is now a crowded and competitive charity marketplace, fundraising can feel like ‘CATCH 22’ for upcoming and diaspora NGOs: without funds their capacity is limited, but NGOs often lack the time, resources and skills to
fundraise effectively.

<br /><br />

The solution we propose for this is a platform through which we can provide targeted outreach to these NGOs.
In our survey, we have identified that individuals, despite having an altruistic outlook on the idea of donation and working of NGOs, have not taken the step forward to financially aid these organizations mainly due to two reasons. <br /><br />

1.Empathy: <br />
As stated before, fundraising requires a substantial amount of skill and resources and often these are put in vain as not every individual is empathic with the values of the NGOs and with what they want to achieve.Hence, we would want to help these NGOs better spend their resources, providing targeted outreach to potential donors. <br /><br />
 
2.Financial: <br />
The individuals with whom we spoke stated their interest in donating to NGOs but faced issues in identifying legitimate organizations and interfaces for the easy transactions of financial aid. <br /><br />

In essence we want to be the first organization, who provide an active approach to fundraising for NGOs. <br /><br />
