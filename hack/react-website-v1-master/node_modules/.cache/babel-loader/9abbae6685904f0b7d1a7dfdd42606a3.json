You may feel pity for them but you don’t really give them much thought. Poverty, after all, is an inevitable part of society and there’s nothing you can do about it.\r\n\r\nYes, poverty is inevitable and even the wealthiest countries have underprivileged children. But that doesn’t mean you can’t do anything to ease their plight. Remember that even the smallest drop of water can cause ripples in the ocean.\r\n\r\nBut before we talk about what we can do for these children, let’s first delve deep into what being underprivileged really means.\r\nrom the term itself, “underprivileged” children are those who do not enjoy the same advantages or rights as most kids their age. Most of the time, we equate it to being poor.\r\n\r\nBut being underprivileged is more than just coming from a low-income background. Underprivileged children also often don’t have access to quality education, shelter, healthy food, and medical care. This makes them vulnerable to malnutrition, diseases, and exploitation.\r\n\r\nIn essence, they are robbed of a normal and happy childhood – something that we can all agree every child deserves.\r\n\r\nAccording toUnicef, there are about 1 billion children around the world that can be categorically called “underprivileged”. In the US alone,nearly 1 in 7 children live in poverty. A majority of them don’t even have access to enough food. While many others are living in shelters, cars, and public places.\r\n\r\nWhile all of their troubles seem to be rooted in poverty, we cannot discount the fact that deep-seated social problems also play a role.\r\n\r\nMost underprivileged children came from single-parent families. These parents also didn’t have proper education which leads to limited employment opportunities. They also tend to be more prone to domestic violence from their partners. This, in turn, can leave a huge trauma to their children. And thus, the cycle never ends. */}\r\n        </h3>\r\n      </div>\r\n    \r\n      )\r\n  \r\n  }\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,eAAe,SAASC,IAAT,GAAgB;EAC3B,oBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,UAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAI,SAAS,EAAC,MAAd;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,0BADF,eAEE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAFF,eAGE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAHF,CADF;AA0BD"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
