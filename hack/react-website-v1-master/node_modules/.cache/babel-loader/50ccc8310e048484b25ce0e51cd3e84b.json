Fundraising is one of the most important pieces of the organizational jigsaw. Quite clearly, without funds, an NGO will cease to exist or at least not be able to effectively serve the communities that it has been set up to serve. In what is now a crowded and competitive charity marketplace, fundraising can feel like \\u2018CATCH 22\\u2019 for upcoming and diaspora NGOs: without funds their capacity is limited, but NGOs often lack the time, resources and skills to fundraise effectively. Solution: The solution we propose for this is a platform through which we can provide targeted outreach to these NGOs. In our survey, we have identified that individuals, despite having an altruistic outlook on the idea of donation and working of NGOs, have not taken the step forward to financially aid these organizations mainly due to two reasons. 1.Empathy: As stated before, fundraising requires a substantial amount of skill and resources and often these are put in vain as not every individual is empathic with the values of the NGOs and with what they want to achieve.Hence, we would want to help these NGOs better spend their resources, providing targeted outreach to potential donors. 2.Financial: The individuals with whom we spoke stated their interest in donating to NGOs but faced issues in identifying legitimate organizations and interfaces for the easy transactions of financial aid. In essence we want to be the first organization, who provide an active approach to fundraising for NGOs. Technology: 1.Web Page: ReactJS,Firebase The NGO\\u2019s first point of contact with us is our website. This website will consist of a basic sign in page.The client will be directed to a page where the organization fills in information with regards to their vision, activities and areas in which their championing change.With this information, we will build a basket of potential donors, to run targeted ads for the organization. 2.Chatbot We plan to get customer information from various sources, identify and categorize the potential donors based on certain parameters and send them personalized messages . We plan to gain the users trust by sending them information about NGOs operations and provide them with supporting stats. Once the user shows interest, we will read the messages using our automated chatbot and reply. In this process our chatbot learns, becomes more efficient in terms of replying to users or even identifying what the user wants to know. Will deploy it on Whatsapp ( from our survey, we have inferred that individuals prefer Whatsapp as their primary form of communication instead of traditional messages or email because of its easy interface) using neural network , Natural Language Processing 3.
